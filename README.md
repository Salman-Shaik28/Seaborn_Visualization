# Graph Types Examples with Seaborn and Matplotlib

This repository contains a Google Colab-compatible notebook demonstrating various graph types using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The dataset `BAC.csv` is used to generate visualizations, helping to understand different chart types and their use cases.

## Graphs Covered
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualizes the relationship between two variables.
- **Bar Plot**: Displays data using rectangular bars to show comparisons.
- **Histogram Plot**: Represents the distribution of data.
- **Displot**: Provides distribution plots with additional flexibility.
- **Joint Plot**: Combines scatter plot and histogram for bivariate data analysis.
- **Pair Plot**: Displays pairwise relationships in a dataset.
- **Box Plot**: Visualizes data distribution through quartiles.
- **Catplot**: Used for visualizing categorical data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (or Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Salman-Shaik28/Seaborn_Visualization
    ```
2. Upload the notebook and the `BAC.csv` dataset to your Google Colab environment.
3. Ensure the required libraries are installed by running:
    ```python
    !pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
    ```
4. Run the notebook cells to visualize the graphs.
